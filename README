Test-More-Behaviours version 0.0.2

This module was initially written by Antony Marcano when he was working with my team to help us practicing Test Driven Development.

It doesn't do much but it helps keeping Test::More based tests organised and documented in a way that make sense.
In addition, the set_up() and tear_down() mecanisms provided by JUnit was missed by Antony (who has a background in Java Devlopment), so this feature has been added.

This module has also been used and exerciced during several Coding Dojos.
